# audioExtraction

The spectrumAnalyzer class gets an input stream from the laptop mic and plots the real time wave form.
Also displays FFT of microphone audio stream.

TO DO:
- allow input of .wav files
- extract MFCCs from frequency spectrum

Maybe TO DOs:
- use wave instead of numpy
- add chroma extractor
- plot mfcc and chroma using matplotlib
